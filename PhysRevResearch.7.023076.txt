We present a quantum algorithm for simulating a family of Markovian master equations that can be re-
alized through a probabilistic application of unitary channels and state preparation. Our approach employs
a second-order product formula for the Lindblad master equation, achieved by decomposing the dynamics
into dissipative and Hamiltonian components and replacing the dissipative segments with randomly compiled,
easily implementable elements. The sampling approach eliminates the need for ancillary qubits to simulate the
dissipation process and reduces the gate complexity in terms of the number of jump operators. We provide
a rigorous performance analysis of the algorithm. We also extend the algorithm to time-dependent Lindblad
equations, generalize the family of Markovian master equations it can be applied to, and explore applications
beyond the Markovian noise model. A new error bound, in terms of the diamond norm, for second-order product
formulas for time-dependent Liouvillians is provided that might be of independent interest.

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the ﬁrst suggested applications of quantum com-
puting was to simulate quantum mechanical systems [ 1].
Since Feynman’s initial proposal, the ﬁeld of quantum sim-
ulation has grown rapidly, resulting in numerous algorithms
that offer asymptotic speedups over the best possible classi-
cal algorithms. Initially, much focus has been on simulating
closed quantum systems [2–9], only recently has there been
a signiﬁcant interest in developing quantum algorithms for
simulating open quantum systems [10–23]. Notable exam-
ples are algorithms to simulate a single quantum channel
applied to an input quantum state [11,15,19], algorithms that
simulate continuous-time dynamics describable by master
equations [10–14,16,20]. Special attention is paid to dynamics
generated by time-independent Lindblad master equations,
since they cover the common scenario of a quantum system
weakly coupled to a Markovian environment. Some exam-
ples include Refs. [10–14,16,20–22] with [13] achieving the
current state-of-the-art asymptotic scaling. Similar to Hamil-
tonian simulation, the current classical Lindblad simulation
algorithms are inefﬁcient, thus efﬁcient quantum algorithms
for Lindblad simulation could prove useful for future scientiﬁc
needs.
Interestingly, many of the current Lindblad simulation
algorithms share common features. They deterministically
implement the full set of jump operators for the Lindbladian
and treat both the dissipative and unitary dynamics on equal

footing. In addition, the resources required by these algo-
rithms explicitly increase (polynomially) with respect to the
number of Lindblad jump operators along with the overall
norm of the Lindbladian. A missing feature in the exist-
ing algorithms is taking advantage of the fact that in many
realistic open system dynamics, there are classical uncertain-
ties regarding the effect of the environment on the system.
This noise-agnostic approach can lead to situations where the
noisy open system simulation algorithms can scale worse,
sometimes even exponentially worse, than simulating the
noiseless system. For example, naive algorithms to simulate
Hamiltonian evolution in the presence of global depolar-
izing noise would require exponential time for many of
the general-purpose open quantum system algorithms, given
the fact that global depolarization requires exponentially
many jump operators. However, such an explicit scaling with
the number of jump operators can be reduced if the clas-
sical randomness, present in the description of the open
system dynamics, is directly incorporated into the design
of the algorithm to simulate dissipation. This strategy has
recently been considered for a restricted class of Lindbladi-
ans, in which a ﬁrst-order approximation to a dissipator is
used for thermal state preparation on a quantum computer
[24]. It has also been used to simulate Lindblad dynamics
through leveraging the intrinsic noise of quantum proces-
sors [21,22], as well as in the design of an algorithm that
uses a classical processor alongside a quantum computer
to reconstruct the dynamics based on a series of sampled
states [25].
In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for sim-
ulating both the coherent and dissipative evolution of a
Lindbladian, with no need for any ancilla qubits and reduced
gate complexity in the number of jump operators, although for
a restricted class of Lindbladians. The class of Lindbladians

we consider are sums of a Hamiltonian part and a dissipator,
where the dissipator is constrained to generate channels that
are convex combinations of unitary channels and ﬁxed state
preparation. Although our noise model is restrictive, it does
encapsulate many physically relevant dissipative processes
such as both local and global depolarizing noise, dephasing
and bit-ﬂip noise, and other random Pauli channels. The al-
gorithm we introduce uses a second-order product formula to
divide the generator into its Hamiltonian part and dissipator.
We then simulate the dissipative portion using a sampling
protocol, with the Hamiltonian dynamics being simulated us-
ing any Hamiltonian simulation algorithm preferred. The only
ancillary qubits needed by the algorithm are what is needed
to implement the desired Hamiltonian simulation subroutine.
The scaling of the circuit with respect to simulation time
and precision isO(T
1.5/√ϵ ), whereT is the total simulation
time and ϵ is the accuracy in the diamond norm. This is an
improvement over the O(T 2/ϵ ) scaling of the randomized
Lindblad simulation algorithm presented in Ref. [24], which
also eliminates the circuits scaling on the number of jump
operators.
We also generalize the algorithm to simulate a family of
time-dependent Lindbladians. To analyze the performance in
the time-dependent case, we prove a new second-order prod-
uct formula for time-dependent Louvillians, consisting of an
arbitrary time-dependent and an arbitrary time-independent
term, which might be of independent interest. Additionally,
we explore how limited ancillary qubits can broaden the
scope of master equations that our algorithm can simulate,
for example simulating local amplitude damping noise using
a few ancilla qubits. We also discuss methods to extend the
algorithm to non-Markovian master equations. Finally, we
conclude with providing a few demonstrations of our algo-
rithm applied to various master equations.
II. STOCHASTICALLY SIMULATABLE CHANNELS
Let E be a CPTP map that can be simulated stochas-
tically, i.e., it can be implemented by sampling a set of
quantum operations {A
i} according to probabilities pi such
that E(ρ) = E[Ai(ρ)] holds. Then the measurement statistics
of any quantum circuit composed of multiple applications
of E can be reproduced by replacing any application ofE
with an implementation ofA
i sampled independently. In this
work we are interested in estimating the expected value of a
general observable using our simulation algorithm. With the
goal of designing a low-cost quantum algorithm, we restrict
the operations A
i to be either unitary or ﬁxed state prepara-
tion operations. More speciﬁcally, we consider stochastically
simulatable channels as deﬁned below.
Deﬁnition 1. We callE a stochastically simulatable chan-
nel if it can be written as:
E(ρ) = q
(∑
i
λiUiρU†
i
)
+ (1 − q)ρf , (1)
where Ui are unitary operators and ρf is a ﬁxed quantum
state. Scalars q and λi are constrained such that 0⩽ q ⩽ 1,
0 ⩽ λi ⩽ 1, and∑
i λi = 1.
repeat r-times
nρ Kδt Nδt Kδt
FIG. 1. Simulation gadget.
The cost of implementingE solely depends on the com-
plexity of implementing{Ui} and also the preparation ofρf .
Ideally these operations should be efﬁciently implementable.
Some examples include when{U
i} are n-fold tensor products
of single-qubit unitaries and also when they are generated by
Clifford circuits.
In this work we mainly focus on simulating open
quantum systems described by a Lindblad master equa-
tion, given as
dρ
dt = L(ρ) with L = H + D, where H(ρ) =
−i[H,ρ ] generates Hamiltonian evolution and the dissipator
D(ρ) = ∑ m
μ=1(LμρL†
μ − 1
2 {L†
μLμ,ρ }) models the system-
environment interactions. HereH is the system Hamiltonian
and Lμ are the Lindblad’s jump operators.
An example of a class of Lindblad superoperators that
satisfy Deﬁnition 1 for a small interval of time are dissipators
D with jump operatorsLμ = αμUμ where Uμ is unitary. It is
straightforward to check that in this case, whenδt∥D∥⋄ ⩽ 1,
the operator eδtD can be approximated by a random unitary
channel with arbitrarily small error, see AppendixA. When
Uμ belongs to a group of efﬁciently implementable unitaries,
such as n-fold tensor products of single-qubit unitaries or
Clifford circuits, then the random unitary channel ﬁts our
ideal scenario discussed above, since the complexity of imple-
mentation does not change when the unitaries are composed.
This class of Lindblad master equations captures many useful
families including random Pauli channels.
III. NEW ALGORITHM
We now introduce the quantum algorithm to simulate
Lindbladian dynamics. In its simplest form, given a time-
independent Lindblad superoperatorL = H + D where H is
the generator of the Hamiltonian dynamics andD is the gen-
erator of a (approximately) stochastically simulatable map,
our proposed algorithm simulates the evolution of an arbitrary
input stateρ under L up to timeT and precisionϵ by repeat-
edly implementing Lindbladian simulation gadgets depicted
in Fig.1.
Each Lindbladian simulation gadget is built of two dif-
ferent subroutines, one implementing the map K
δt , which
approximates e
δt
2 H and can be executed using any choice of
Hamiltonian simulation algorithm, and the other,Nδt which
approximates eδtD in expectation using a simple sampling
routine.
As discussed, we assume D generates an approximately
stochastically simulatable map over a small period of timeδt.
Thus we can we writeeδtD = Nδt + O(δt3 ), where Nδt is a
stochastically simulatable map, i.e., satisfying Deﬁnition 1.
Since Nδt satisﬁes Deﬁnition 1, we can write
Nδt (ρ) = q(δt )

The above equation suggests a simple method to implement
our approximation to the mapeδtD, simply samplei ∼ pi(δt )
and implement the operationA(i)
δt . Thus the gate complexity
of Nδt is independent of the number of jump operators and
only depends on the complexity of implementing unitaries
U (i)
δt and ﬁxed state preparation oraclePδt , which replaces the
state of the system with a ﬁxed state. This procedure assures
the measurement statistics over many different compilations
of the quantum circuit implementing N
δt will replicate the
measurement statistics of a single circuit implementingNδt
exactly.
Thus when compiling each of the Lindbladian simulation
gadgets, we independently samplei ∼ pi(δt ) and implement
the operation A(i)
δt in place of Nδt in the gadget. The full
algorithm consists of sequentially repeating the blocks ofKδt
using any closed-system quantum simulation algorithm of
choice, and sampling A(i)
δt for each Nδt block. The number
of repetitions r, required to guarantee a desired accuracyϵ,
would determine the query complexity of the algorithm.
A. Algorithm analysis
At a high level, to analyze the performance of the
algorithm, we leverage a product formula for Lindblad su-
peroperators to split up the dynamics into its Hamiltonian
part and a stochastically simulatable dissipator. The total
simulation time and precision then constrain the individual
subroutines’ precision and simulation time. Since we can im-
plement N
δt without error, our constraints only apply to the
Hamiltonian simulation subroutineKδt .
First, we introduce some notation. The diamond norm of
a linear mapL over linear operators on a ﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert space is deﬁned as∥L∥⋄ = max∥ρ∥1=1 ∥I ⊗ L(ρ)∥1,
where ∥·∥ 1 denotes the trace norm andI the identity map.
Following Ref. [20] we deﬁne∥L∥pauli of a Lindblad superop-
erator L as ∥L∥pauli = ∑ s−1
k=0 β0k + ∑ m
μ=1(∑ s−1
k=0 βμk )2, where
H = ∑ s−1
k=0 β0kV0k, andLμ = ∑ s−1
k=0 βμkVμk with βμk > 0 and
Vμk an n-fold tensor product of Pauli operators with arbitrary
phases. Finally, we denote the total simulation time and preci-
sion byT and ϵ, respectively.
We proceed by ﬁnding an upper bound on the error be-
tween r applications of our subroutines and the true evolution
generated byL. Assuming (
∥H∥⋄
2 +∥ D∥⋄ )δt ⩽ 1, we can ap-
ply a second-order product formula [26] (see Theorem2 for
our generalized version), alongside the submultiplicative and
additive properties of the diamond norm [27] to get:
∥eT L − (Kδt ◦ Nδt ◦ Kδt )r∥⋄
⩽ ∥[H,D]∥⋄
3
(∥H∥⋄
2 + ∥D∥⋄
)
rδt3 + 2r(ϵH + ϵD ), (6)
where ϵH =∥ e
δt
2 H − Kδt ∥⋄ and ϵD =∥ eδtD − Nδt ∥⋄ , which
represent the errors each of our subroutines incur.
To formalize our assumption about the generatorD,w e
require
ϵD =∥ eδtD − Nδt ∥⋄ ⩽ c0(∥D∥⋄ δt )3, (7)
where c0 is a constant determined by the speciﬁcs of the
dissipator D. As discussed before, dissipators with jump op-
erators of the form Lμ = αμUμ can be approximated by a
stochastically simulatable channel up to arbitrary small er-
ror. Such dissipators are an example of when requirement
(7) is satisﬁed. Using ∥L∥
⋄ ⩽ 2∥L∥pauli from [20] to carry
out the upper bounds in terms of ∥·∥ pauli gives us a way
to easily compare to the state-of-the-art Lindblad simulation
algorithms [14,20,25]. Thus our bound becomes,
∥e
T L − (Kδt ◦ Nδt ◦ Kδt )r∥⋄
⩽ 8
3 r(1 + 6c0 )(∥L∥pauliδt )3 + 2rϵH . (8)
To keep the precision of the total simulation over timeT
within total error ofO(ϵ )E q .(8) implies we must taker =
O(
√
1+6c0
ϵ (∥L∥pauliT )1.5 ), and ϵH = O(ϵ/r). All that is left is
to design an implementation of the Hamiltonian simulation
subroutine.
Choosing to use the truncated Taylor series algorithm of
Ref. [7] provides the gate complexity for the subroutine to
be ˜O(δt∥H∥paulisn log(
δt∥H∥pauli
ϵH
)), where n is the number of
qubits and s is the number of Pauli terms in the Hamilto-
nian. The total gate complexity is just the subroutine’s cost
multiplied by r. Since subroutine N
δt does not require any
ancilla to implement, the only ancilla cost of the algorithm
comes from our implementation ofK
δt . Assuming we can re-
set the ancilla registers before eachKδt subroutine, algorithm
of Ref. [7] gives us the ancilla cost for implementingKδt to
be ˜O[log(s)l o g (δt/ϵH )].
Alternatively, we could use an algorithm based on product
formulas [28,29] to implement the Hamiltonian simulation
subroutine Kδt , which would remove the need for any ancilla,
at the expense of a worse gate complexity to simulate the
Hamiltonian dynamics. We can summarize the analysis in the
following theorem.
Theorem 1. Let L = H + D be a Lindbladian with Hamil-
tonian portion H and dissipative portion D. Assume D
generates an approximately stochastically simulatable chan-
nel satisfying (7). Then there exists a quantum algorithm that

beyond what is required for the Hamiltonian simulation
subroutine Kδt .
IV . EXTENSIONS
The algorithm described above can only simulated Lind-
bladians, which are time independent and satisfy our con-
straint of being composed of a dissipator, which generates
a channel that approximately satisﬁes Deﬁnition 1.I nt h e
sections to follow we show how the algorithm described above
can be generalized to include Lindbladians with dissipators
that are time dependent, how to go beyond the constraint of
Deﬁnition 1, as well as how to incorporate certain kinds of
non-Markovian dissipation.
A. Time-dependent Lindblad equation
The algorithm and analysis above can be generalized to
include time-dependent Lindblad superoperators with a time-
dependent dissipative portionD(t ). If the dissipator generates
a channel that is approximately stochastically simulatable at
all times, i.e.,
T e
∫t+δt
t D(t′)dt ′
[ρ(t )] = Nt,δt [ρ(t )] + O(δt3 ), (10)
holds for allt, then the algorithm can be easily modiﬁed to
simulate such systems. To do so we leverage Theorem2 to
divide the time-dependent dynamics into its time-dependent
dissipator and its Hamiltonian part.

Proof. See AppendixB. ■
Similar to the time-independent case, we implement sub-
routines to approximate the dynamics generated by these two
generators. The only difference lies in how we implement
the dissipative subroutine. In the time-dependent case, we
implement the stochastically simulatable channels N
t,δt as
our subroutine approximating the dissipative dynamics. Since
N
t,δt explicitly depends on time, we will implement different
stochastically simulatable channels at each time stept where
we require a dissipative subroutine. The rest of the analysis
of the algorithm is similar to the time-independent case. The
total costs as shown above hold in the time-dependent sce-
nario with the only difference being, replacing∥L∥
pauli with
supt ∥L(t )∥pauli and c0 with supt c0(t ) in Theorem1.
B. Generalized noise model via ancilla qubits
At the expense of adding ancilla qubits and applying
unitary operations on the joint system, one can extend the
scope of the proposed method to simulate a larger family of
noise models. The Stinespring dilation theorem guarantees
that any CPTP map acting on 2
l × 2l density operators can
be implemented by adding 2l ancilla qubits and performing a
(generally complicated) unitary operation on the joint system
[30]. However, the probabilistic implementation of channels
can reduce this ancilla requirement.
Remark 1. The algorithm can implement any CPTP map
acting on 2
l × 2l density operators using at most l ancilla
qubits.
This observation follows from the fact that any such a map
can be expressed as a convex combination of extremal chan-
nels with each extremal channel only having at most 2
l many
Kraus operators [31]. Therefore implementation of dilatation
of any of the extremal channels requires at most l ancilla
qubits. Given that only one extremal channel needs to be
implemented in each compilation, at mostl ancilla sufﬁces in
each run. The ancilla qubits can be reset after the application
of the channel.
Simulation of local noise, naturally arising in many phys-
ical systems, is of particular interest. A local (but possibly
correlated) noise model can be described by a CPTP map,
E(ρ) =
∑
i
λiG(i)
0 ⊗ ... ⊗ G(i)
n−1(ρ), (12)
where eachG(i)
j acts on thejth qubit, withl = 1. If eachG(i)
j
is unital then we can expand each operation in terms of a
convex combination of single-qubit unitaries. This gives us
a description of the operation that satisﬁes Deﬁnition1 where
the U
i(t ) operations aren-fold tensor products of single-qubit
unitaries, thus efﬁciently implementable. IfG(i)
j are not unital,
for example such as amplitude damping, then we only need
one ancilla rather than two, to implement each of the local
maps. Therefore the full noisy processE(ρ) can be simulated
by adding at mostn extra ancilla qubits and two-qubit gates,
which is less than the 2n ancilla needed if we chose to directly
dilate.
C. Incorporating time correlations
As discussed, to simulate a time-dependent Markovian
master equation, we implement each dissipation block ofNt,δt
by generating samples independent from the other blocks.
However, it is straightforward to modify the algorithm to
simulate dynamics that have correlations in time by simply
introducing correlations in the sampling of dissipation blocks
used in the compilation. In particular, the probabilities and
operations in Eqs. (3) and (4) can be generalized to deﬁne
joint probabilities and operations over multiple time steps.
Therefore, the domain of master equations simulable by the
presented algorithm goes beyond the Markovian master equa-
tion we focused on in this work.
V . DEMONSTRATIONS
Given the algorithm and extensions described above, we
provide three different demonstrations of our algorithm to
follow. For the ﬁrst example we consider an arbitrary Hamil-
tonian simulation problem onn qubits under both global and
local depolarizing noise. Although global depolarization is
not the most physically relevant noise model for systems,
it sufﬁces to demonstrate that our algorithm can handle a
dissipator with an exponential number of jump operators. The
second example we provide is the simulation of crosstalk
on superconducting transmon qubits. Finally we describe
how 1/f noise on superconducting transmon qubits can be

simulated using the extension of our algorithm to dissipation
that correlates in time.
A. Hamiltonian simulation under depolarizing dissipation
Consider the case of a LindbladianL, which generates ar-
bitrary Hamiltonian evolution along with global depolarizing
noise,

where H is an arbitrary Hamiltonian,γ ∈ R+ \{ 0}, andVμ ∈
{I,X,Y,Z}⊗n \{ I⊗n}. There arem = 4n − 1 jump operators
for Dγ of the formLμ =
√
γ
4n Vμ. SinceVμ is unitary, we know
from Appendix A that eδtD is approximately stochastically
simulatable up to arbitrary precision. Thus oraclesA(i)
δt are
compositions of elements in{I,X,Y,Z}⊗n \{ I⊗n} implying
A(i)
δt ∈{ I,X,Y,Z}⊗n. Calculating∥L∥pauli gives us

Since the jump operatorsLμ =

Since A(i)
δt ∈{ I,X,Y,Z}⊗n, each A(i)
δt is an n-fold ten-

δt
requires O(n) single-qubit gates to implement. Applying The-

For the example of local depolarizing dissipation, consider
the case when D generates one-local depolarizing noise. In
this case, the jump operators have the formLμ =
√
γ
4 Vμ where
Vμ ∈{ X,Y,Z} and acts on theμth qubit. The analysis follows
similar to the above with γ replaced by nγ/4 in the ﬁnal
results. Similarly, oraclesA(i)
δt become n-fold tensor products
of single-qubit unitaries.
B. Crosstalk in superconducting transmons
As a second demonstration of our algorithm we will sim-
ulate the evolution of two superconducting transmon qubits
undergoing ZZ -crosstalk noise. ZZ crosstalk is a common
source of noise in superconducting transmon qubits given
that the two-localZ interaction is always present in the joint
system’s Hamiltonian. In order to model ZZ-crosstalk on su-
perconducting hardware, Tripathi et al. in Ref. [32]u s ea

where ωi is theith transmon qubit’s frequency in the rotating
frame andZi is the PauliZ operator acting on theith transmon
qubit. The dissipatorD used hasm = 3 jump operators of the
following form:
Lμ =
{√γμZμ for i ∈{ 1,2}
√γμZ1Z2 otherwise , (20)
where γμ ∈ R+ \{ 0}. The full system dynamics is given by

Since each Lμ is proportional to some unitary, we can
approximate the channeleδtD up to arbitrary precision with a
stochastically simulatable channel, as shown in AppendixA.
Setting this channel to be our dissipative simulation subrou-
tine N
δt gives us oraclesA(i)
δt ∈{ Z1,Z2,Z1Z2} which can be
implemented in the worst case with only two one-qubit gates.

to both our Hamiltonian simulation subroutineKδt and our
dissipative simulation subroutineNδt .
Given that all of the terms in the system HamiltonianH
commute, we will choose to instantiateKδt using a product
formula algorithm. Applying Theorem 6 of Ref. [ 29]w e
ﬁnd that even a ﬁrst-order product formula sufﬁces to pro-
vide us with an approximation toe
δt
2 H with no error. Thus
we only need to implement an approximation to the unitary
e−i Jδt
2 Z1Z2 e−i ω2δt
2 Z2 e−i ω1δt
2 Z1 where δt = T /r, this can be done
in O(1) one- and two-qubit gates. Thus the total one- and
two-qubit gate cost in the worst case to simulate the dynamics
of two superconducting transmons undergoingZZ crosstalk is
given by Eq. (23)a sw e l l .
C. 1/ f dephasing in superconducting transmons
As a ﬁnal demonstration of our algorithm we will describe
a simulation of n superconducting transmon qubits under-
going local 1/f dephasing. As described in Ref. [33], and
in the previous example, the time-independent Hamiltonian
for n transmon qubits can be modeled as H = ∑
n
i=1 Hi =∑ n
i=1 ωiZi/2 where ωi is the ith transmon’s frequency, and
Zi the Pauli Z operator acting on theith transmon qubit. For
this example we assume theZZ crosstalk between the various
transmon qubits has been suppressed and we can drop the
two-local interaction terms in the system Hamiltonian. Local
dephasing is generated by a dissipator with jump operators of
the formL
μ(t ) =
√
/Gamma1μ(t )
2 Zμ where Zμ is the PauliZ operator,
which acts on theμth transmon qubit./Gamma1μ(t ) is the dephasing
rate for the μth qubit and sources the noise in the system.
Since our noise source has a power spectral density of 1/f ,
we assume each /Gamma1μ(t ) is a stochastic process with such a
power spectral density associated to it. We also assume that
each /Gamma1
μ(t ) is independent. The dynamics of the system is then
given by
dρ
dt =
n∑
μ=1
(
−i
[ωμ

]
+ /Gamma1μ(t )
2 (ZμρZμ − ρ)
)
=
n∑
μ=1
(−i[Hμ,ρ ] + Dμ(t )(ρ)). (24)
We can sample from the stochastic process/Gamma1μ(t ) that has
a power spectral density of approximately 1/f by implement-
ing the following procedure described in Ref. [34]. Roughly
speaking this procedure involves numerically approximating
the stochastic process in frequency space, then inverse Fourier
transforming the result. More speciﬁcally, given the ﬁnal time
T and number of samplesN needed of the random process, we
can generate a set of{/Gamma1
μ(tk )}N−1
k=0 samples where tk = kδt =
Tk /N by following the subsequently described procedure. For
each frequency ωm = 2πm/T we sample Xm,Ym ∼ N (0,1)
where N denotes the Gaussian distribution. We then compute
the mth Fourier weight as
˜/Gamma1μ(ωm ) =
√
1
2|ωm|(Xm + iYm ). (25)
To assure/Gamma1μ(tk ) ∈ R we constrain ˜/Gamma1μ(ωN−m ) = ˜/Gamma1μ(ωm )∗ al-
lowing us to only compute half of the Fourier weights. Finally
we compute each/Gamma1
μ(tk ) as the inverse Fourier transform of
˜/Gamma1μ(ωm ) given by
/Gamma1μ(tk ) = 1√
N
N−1∑
m=0
˜/Gamma1μ(ωm )e−iωmtk . (26)
The resulting set of samples{/Gamma1μ(tk )}N−1
k=1 has a power spectral
density of approximately 1/f . We can then take the absolute
value of each of the samples giving us a set{/Gamma1μ(tk )}N−1
k=0 of
dephasing rates, which are positive.
To simulate the dynamics described by Eq. (24) we design
subroutines Kδt , andNt,δt to simulate the coherent and dissi-
pative dynamics respectively. Since each of the superoperators
in the sum of Eq. (24) act only on a single qubit, it sufﬁces
to consider subroutinesK
(μ)
δt and N (μ)
t,δt where each subroutine
acts only on theμth qubit and
Kδt =
n⨂
μ=1
K(μ)
δt and Nt,δt =
n⨂
μ=1
N (μ)
t,δt . (27)
The μth dissipative subroutine approximates the map
T e
∫ti+δt
ti dt Dμ(t ) = (1 − /Gamma1μ(ti )δt + /Gamma1μ(ti )δt2 )I
+ (/Gamma1μ(ti )δt − /Gamma1μ(ti )δt2 )Zμ + O(δt3 ),
(28)
where Zμ(ρ) = ZμρZμ. Note, the right-hand side of the above
equation ﬁts our deﬁnition of being an approximately stochas-
tically simulatable up to errorO(δt
3 ). Thus we deﬁne theμth
dissipative subroutine as
N (μ)
ti,δt = {1 − p[/Gamma1μ(ti ),δ t]}I + p[/Gamma1μ(ti ),δ t]Zμ, (29)
where probability p[/Gamma1μ(ti ),δ t] = /Gamma1μ(ti )δt − /Gamma1μ(ti )δt2. Con-
sidering the non-Markovian nature of our noise source/Gamma1μ(t ),
the probabilities at each time stepp[/Gamma1μ(ti ),δ t] are correlated
with the probabilities at all the other time steps of the sim-
ulation. To sample from such a joint distribution, we ﬁx the
number of time stepsr of the simulation, which impliesδt =
T /r. Next, during compilation of the full quantum circuit, we
classically sample for each qubit a set of 1/f correlated de-
phasing rates{/Gamma1
μ(ti )}r
i=1 using the procedure described above.
Finally, when compiling eachN (μ)
ti,δt subroutine, we classically
compute the probability p[/Gamma1μ(ti ),δ t] and sample whether to
apply Zμ or not. EachZμ operation is a singleZ gate acting
on theμth qubit, thus in the worst case eachNti,δt subroutine
requires O(n) one-qubit gates to implement.
To implement theKδt , we note that eachK(μ)
δt subroutine
approximates the map generated by evolving theμth qubit
under the HamiltonianHμ = ωμZμ/2 for timeδt/2. This cor-
responds to applying the unitarye−i ωμδt
4 Zμ on the μth qubit,
which amounts to applying a single-qubitZ rotation. Thus
each Kδt subroutine can be implemented withO(n) one-qubit

gates. Thus in the worst case the total simulation requires
a circuit of O(rn) one-qubit gates in order to simulate the
dynamics described by Eq. (24), wherer denotes the number
of time steps of the simulation.
VI. DISCUSSION
We have presented a novel quantum algorithm for simu-
lating restricted, but physically motivated, types of dynamics
generated by Lindblad master equations. Our algorithm lever-
ages sampling in the compilation phase of the quantum circuit
to circumvent the overhead of deterministically implementing
all of the jump operators needed to simulate the dynamics.
Our approach eliminates the explicit scaling on the number of
jump operators as it appears in previous algorithms, with the
only scaling depending on the norm of the Lindbladian super-
operator, which all other Lindbladian simulation algorithms
depend on. This strategy also beneﬁts from reduced ancillary
qubit costs, given the only ancilla requirements come from the
choice of Hamiltonian simulation subroutine. We also treat
the closed system dynamics on a different footing than the
dissipative dynamics. This approach allows us to leverage
the wealth of available closed-system quantum algorithms in
addition to extending the algorithm to deal with scenarios
where dissipation may be time dependent or correlated over
time.
It would be interesting to see if our approach of leveraging
classical randomness and treating the dissipative evolution
differently than the closed system evolution can be used
to achieve better scaling with respect to T and ϵ, ideally
O[T polylog(
1
ϵ )] of Ref. [20] but without the dependence on
the number of jump operators and using only a few an-
cillary qubits. Extending the algorithm to incorporate more
general non-Markovian dynamics is another interesting future
direction.

APPENDIX A: EVOLUTION GENERATED BY UNITARY JUMP OPERATORS
Let D be a Lindbladian dissipator with jump operators Lμ. Setting Lμ = αμUμ where Uμ is unitary gives us
D(ρ) = ∑ m
μ=1(LμρL†
μ − 1
2 {L†

μ=1 |αμ|2UμρU†
μ − ∑ m
μ=1 |αμ|2ρ. Deﬁne the random unitary channel R(ρ) =∑ m
μ=1 |αμ|2UμρU†
μ and a = ∑ m
μ=1 |αμ|2, henceD(ρ) = R − aI. Note thateδtD = e−aδtIeδtR. Assumingδt∥R∥⋄ ⩽ 1, we have

Clearly ∑ K
k=0 e−aδt δtk
k! Rk (ρ) is a random unitary channel with non-negative coefﬁcients for anyK. Therefore the evolution can
be approximated with a random unitary channel up to arbitrary accuracy by increasingK. Note that the sum can involve terms
that are up toK multiplication of unitary operators{Uμ}. When{Uμ} belongs to a group of efﬁciently implementable unitaries,
such asn-fold tensor products of single-qubit unitaries or Clifford circuits, which are closed under multiplication, the complexity
of implementing the resulting unitary operators does not grow withK.
APPENDIX B: TIME-DEPENDENT SECOND-ORDER PRODUCT FORMULA
In this section, we prove a time-dependent second-order product formula bound for Liouvillians. For simplicity, we assume
that the LiouvillianL splits up into a time-independent componentH and a time-dependent componentD(t ). This bound is used
in the main text when generalizing our algorithm to incorporate time-dependent dissipators.
Before proving the main result we cite an important Lemma from Klieschet al. [12] that will be useful in the proof.
Lemma 1. Backward time evolution [12]. LetL be a Liouvillian. Fort > s:
(i) TL(t,s) = T e

is invertible and its inverse isT −
L (t,s) as deﬁned by
